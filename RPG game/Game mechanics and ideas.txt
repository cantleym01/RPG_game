How to make the game?
	3 ways to do this:
		1) RPG Maker
		2) C++ (most familiar language)
		3) Java (will be easier than C++ for saving, but still learning)

Code Ideas & Mechanics:

		->Do I want a stat and class system?
			->Yes, a very simple stat system, no player-chosen classes.
				->These are the stats:
					->Hp = Health Points
						->Traditional hp, the character dies when it hits 0.
					->Rs = Resistance
						->A damage mitigation stat.
					->Ap = Attack Power
						->A damage application stat.
					->Lk = Luck
						->A randomizer that gives more variety.
						->Will randomize things from getting hit to doing damage.
					->Fl = Felonic Energy
						->The resource for all ablilities and magic.

		->Will there be an experience and leveling system?
			->Yes.
				->Exp or Experience Points are earned by defeating enemies. (Will revise math later, but these seem do-able)
					->Enemies will award exp on this calculation:
						->((enemy_level * rand(10-20)) * ceil(number_of_enemies / 2))
					->Experience required to level up starts at 150 points.
					->When the player levels up the required Exp is remade to:
						->(Req_Exp * 1.4)

		->Will there be an item system?
			->Yes, there will be armor, weapons, potions, and lore-junk.
				->Armor will be one-piece, all use items.
				->Armor will have a defense stat.
					->Defence will affect Resistance stat.
				->Weapons will be:
					->Chakrams for the Immortal.
					->Swords for the Orphan.
					->Maces for the Soldier.
					->Staves for the Sorceress.
				->Weapons will have a damage and speed stat.
					Damage and Speed will affect the Attack Power stat.
				->There will be level classes for the items, being the following (WILL be revised as no level cap estimated atm):
					->1-20: Iron
					->21-40: Amber
					->41-60: Felonic Steel
				->Potions will restore a static 20% of whichever resource it is meant for.
					->Resources are:
						->Health: Traditional hp, if it hits 0 you die.
						->Felonic Energy: Demon power, it is what fuels abilities, magic, etc.
				->Lore-junk is meant to be there as an inventory filler >:D
					->On a more serious note it is there to give some background on where you are and what is going on in the world.

		->How to handle combat?
			->Working on it...
				->Most likely turn-based combat.

		->What happens when you "die"?
			->You get sent back the beginning of the stage and everything in the room resets.
				->Will most likely use some kinda auto-save feature for entering rooms (If I can figure that out).

		->How to save the game?
			->Still unsure.
