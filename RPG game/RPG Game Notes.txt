Game's Idea:
	Play as 4 heroes, the Orphan, the Soldier, the Sorceress, and the Immortal. Play as the first 3 in small adventures, leading into one big, epic adventure, filled with demons, an evil Tyrant destroying the land, and much more. This game is ambitous, as I hope it has a story and gameplay mechanics so good that it will make grown men weep!

Where to go:
	This game will be made using SDL2 graphics library.

Code Ideas & Mechanics:

		->Do I want a stat and class system?
			->Yes, but a very simple stat system, no player-chosen classes.
				->These are the stats:
					->Hp = Health Points
						->Traditional hp, the character dies when it hits 0.
					->Rs = Resistance
						->A damage mitigation stat.
					->Ap = Attack Power
						->A damage application stat.
					->Lk = Luck
						->A randomizer that gives more variety.

		->Will there be an experience and leveling system?
			->Yes.
				->Exp or Experience Points are earned by defeating enemies. (Will revise math later, but these seem do-able)
					->Enemies will award exp on this calculation:
						->((enemy_level * rand(15-25)) * ceil(number_of_enemies / 2))
					->Experience required to level up starts at 150 points.
					->When the player levels up the required Exp is remade to:
						->(Req_Exp * 1.4)

		->Will there be an item system?
			->Yes, there will be armor, weapons, potions, and lore-junk.
				->Armor will be one-piece items.
				->Armor will have a defense stat.
					->Defence will affect Resistance stat.
				->Weapons will be:
					->Chakrams for the Immortal.
					->Swords for the Orphan.
					->Maces for the Soldier.
					->Staves for the Sorceress.
				->Weapons will have a damage and speed stat.
					Damage and Speed will affect the Attack Power stat.
				->There will be level classes for the items, being the following (WILL be revised as no level cap estimated atm):
					->1-20: Crude
					->21-40: Amber
					->41-60: Fel Crystal
				->Potions will restore a static 20% of whichever resource it is meant for.
					->Resources are:
						->Health: Traditional hp, if it hits 0 you die.
						->Fel: Demon power, it is what fuels abilities, magic, etc.
				->Lore-junk is meant to be there as an inventory filler >:D
					->On a more serious note it is there to give some background on where you are and what is going on in the world.

		->How to handle combat?
			->Working on it...
				->Most likely turn-based combat.

		->How to handle everything being stored eviroment-wise?
			->Definitely want a 2D array
				->Player can look left, right, up, down, forward, and backwards
					->up and down will be smart-ass comments depending on the enviroment.
					->left, right, forward and backwards will be dependant on everything.

		->What happens when you "die"?
			->You get sent back the beginning of the stage and everything in the room resets.
				->Will most likely use some kinda auto-save feature for entering rooms (if I can figure that out).

		->How to save the game?
			->Use object serialization to keep track of what the characters had at the last save location.
			->Will refine on where I save later, but object serialization is good.

		->The Tyrant is the sacrifice, he gave his soul to the Demon King to save his brother, the Immortal, from disease.
			->Tyrant's "condition" is that he is still the same person, but has no control over his body, he can only see what is happening.

		->The Demon King is the Demon (duh), who has orchestrated the next opening of the gates to his dimension.

	->To defeat the Tyrant's army, the Immortal + kin must gain the trust of the 3 smaller kingdoms of the land.
