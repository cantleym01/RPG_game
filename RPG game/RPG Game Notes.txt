Game's Idea:
	Play as 4 heroes, the Orphan, the Soldier, the Sorceress, and the Immortal. Play as the first 3 in small adventures, leading into one big, epic adventure, filled with demons, an evil Tyrant destroying the land, and much more. This game is ambitous, as I hope it has a story and gameplay mechanics so good that it will make grown men weep!

Where to go:
	This game will be made using SDL2 graphics library.

		->The gate is a portal to the Demon King's dimension, dubbed "Planes of Sin".

		->Tyrant kidnaps granddaughter due to being unable to harm his son.

		->The kin are the Orphan, Soldier, and Sorceress (if you couldn't tell).

		->The Immortal is the angel, he believes every human is capable of good, no matter what.

		->The Tyrant is the sacrifice, he gave his soul to the Demon King to save his brother, the Immortal, from disease.
			->Tyrant's "condition" is that he is still the same person, but has no control over his body, he can only see what is happening.

		->The Demon King is the Demon (duh), who has orchestrated the next opening of the gates to his dimension.

	->To defeat the Tyrant's army, the Immortal + kin must gain the trust of the 3 smaller kingdoms of the land. No kingdom will be jumping at the chance due to 	them having treaties with the Tyrant and not wanting to anger him due to his armies size (about 3x human's army).
		->The kingdoms are:
			->The Treant kingdom of Arbor is located in the Forests of Olde.
				->Treants are as old as trees and massive in size.
					->Avg age is 400 years by old age.
				->Treant kingdom is the entire forest.
					->There are few of them left due to Tyrant's foresting.

			->The Human kingdom of Simia is located in the Harsh Mountains.
				->Human's have shortest lifespan.
					->Avg age is 90 by old age.
				->Human's have the largest kingdom.
			
			->The Elven kingdom of Frigus is located in the Northern Snow Plains.
				->Elves are immortal, they can die from everything but old age.
				->Due to living in Snow Plains since their first records, they need care to ventrue from their home.
					->Need special suits to keep from different climates (Think an entire race of Mr.Freezes).
				->Their technology is so advanced due to their understanding of felonic energy and what it is capable of.

		->To gain trust, they must do tasks for the kingdoms depending on what they need.
			->Idea: (maybe random out of 3 different tasks for each kingdom, that would be cool to keep good replay value)

			->Treant: The Treants of the kingdom Arbor want to help and stop the foresting of their land, but know that if they attack as they are they will stand no chance against the Tyrant due to his armies size alone. To act, but not be wiped out they need to find an old artifact that will allow them to age their younglings to adult age. The artifact is lost to them, as they once had one of their bravest young treants hide it so that they will never be able to find it again. They hid it so they could remain a peaceful race, as an artifact that would allow them to double, if not triple, their adult population in only a few days would warrent the attention of other kingdoms. The artifact's power is to age any Treant near it at a pace of an entire Treant lifetime in half a day and form their personalities around the life experiences of the being to last hold the artifact up to the point of them leaving the vecinity of the artifact. The Elder mentions at some point that the last time the artifact was used was when he was before his time. He also mentions who was the last person to imprint upon a group of Treants, the Immortal (dun, duh, duuuh).

				 The heroes are tasked with finding the artifact. To find it they need to venture with a Treant elder, named Klaritus, to the resting place of the Treant who hid the artifact from his own people's sight. A ritual must take place that will allow our heroes, or any non-Treant (Treant magic cannot work on another Treant) to enter the memories of the Treant. Inside the ritual memory, anything they do will have actual interactions; the outcome of history in the real world is unaffected, but anything inside can still be changed, such as their actual death, the death of the Treant they are following and so-on.

				In the memory they will undergo the challenges that the Treant, dubbed Porlaris, had the honor of hiding. Porlaris had the "pleasure" of meeting the heroes as they appeared from thin air in the middle of his journey. Throughout the journey with Porlaris, they go through every event he had with some twists (specify later when writing story, this is just to keep the juices flowing). After they have found the location of the artifact, they have to send a message to the Elder Treant to pull them out (Insert funny dialog about how they didn't think this far ahead). They agreed the best option was for (choice time): Sintheria, the Sorceress, to light up like a christmas tree with her magic or for Vexxis, the orphan, to channel his power.

				Once back in the real world, Klaritus, the elder, welcomes them and asks if they found the location of the artifact. They tell him yes, that it is hidden buried underground where Porlaris took root and was born as a youngling. After aquiring the artifact they hoof it back to Arbor where they put the artifact into effect and make their way to their next destination (end arc).

			->Human: There's a rightful king debate going on between 2 twins. Both want what is best for their people, but both are going about it in different ways. One, named Tencar, wants to lead his kingdom into freedom from the Tyrant, while his brother, named Malidore, wants to keep his kingdom safe under the Tyrant's reign, and honestly believes it is best. Their mother and father, the queen and king, named Sayrwa and Elindar respectively, had been assassinated by an unknown assassin.

			->Elf: missing research team, prince is with them.
